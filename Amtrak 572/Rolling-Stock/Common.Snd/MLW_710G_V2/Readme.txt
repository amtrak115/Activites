MLW MSTS 710G Version 2 Set. 5/27/09
_______________________________
FEATURES:
Highly realistic engine recordings from 710 Equipped diesels.
Different idle recordings for different locomotive types with 710's.
Different EFI/Cooling fan whine per locomotive types.
Air drier sounds as per-prototype.
Random air release, compressor and radio sounds (radio in cab).
Many other various realistic subtle features that are missing from our MSTS experience.

INSTALLATION:
1. Unzip the zip file to your x:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\Trainset\COMMON.SND\ directory. That is for Win-XP and lower. I don't have Vista, so figure it out yourself if your do have it.
2. Make sure you have the MLW_Horns set installed in the COMMON.SND, you won't have horns without it.
3. To Alias locomotives per railroad please consider the following:
a. Use this common string to setup your aliases:
"..\\..\\COMMON.SND\\MLW_710G_V2\\(Railroad here)(Locomotive Type here)_(cab or eng).sms"
b. Simple, eh? Just insert the railroad and Locomotive and such where it says. But REMEMBER to follow the actual SMS file names in the MLW_710G_V2 folder.
4. Additional Alias info:
For CP/SOO SD60's use the SP GP60 SMS files, pretty much the same thing.
Any other alias questions can be emailed to bnsfdude5@yahoo.com. Please DO NOT ask me to alias locomotives for you. I'm not your mom and I'm not going to hold your hand. I'll talk you through it.
