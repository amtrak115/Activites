You must have the BN set that contains the shape file for BN_GP38_2105 in order to make this repaint work.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Unzip this download to a temporary file named ATSF_GP38_2862 and place it in your TRAINSET directory of MSTS
2. Copy the shape file of BN_GP38_2105.s into the file and rename it ATSF_GP38_2862.s. Rename my shape files, GP38_2862a and 
   GP38_2862b back to the original models shape files GP38a and GP38b  	
3. Sound is aliased to Matt Florack's MC_EMD645 available at http://mclw.proboards.com/index.cgi
4. Copy cab view from the BN pack into the ATSF_GP38_2862 file.
5. Make a consist and enjoy

NOTE: This will not look correct in Shape Viewer but did work correctly for me in the Sim. I could not figure it out.
      Anyone who would like to attempt to correct it may do so.

Thanks to the SLI folks for their repaint policy!
