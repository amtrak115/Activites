MSTS MOW train set.  This is a repaint of the CSX MOW train set and  the SP bay window caboose done with the permission of the authors.  This new set has cars with MOW markings but no roadnames so it can be used on a variety of routes.  Credits to the original authors are found in the Readme file.  Updated physics by Bob "Plainsman" Boudoin.  Repainted by Mark Giltz.

SOUNDS: I don't know how to edit the .wag file for the crane safely to eliminate the necessity for the sound file.  Just add the cranecab.sms file in the Sound folder in this zip file to your main sound folder to make sure the car will load into the game.

CONSISTS:

The crane is facing forward and the boomcar should be placed in front of the crane car.  If you reverse the direction of the crane car the boomcar should be placed behind the crane car. DO NOT OPERATE THE CRANE CAR IN HIGH SPEED CONSISTS.  Bob Boudouin set the physics for the crane car to operate in a correct low-speed environment.  The crane should be unstable at high speeds.  The crane will have a 5-key passenger view if no other car with a passenger view is placed in the consist.

The car MOW gondola noends rails should have cars MOW gondola noends empty 1 and MOW gondola noends empty 2 placed in front of and behind that car to carry the overhang from the oversized rails load.
