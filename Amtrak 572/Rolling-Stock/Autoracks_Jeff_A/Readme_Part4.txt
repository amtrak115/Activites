MSTS 89' Autorack Pack Part 4 (Add-on pak)

Contained within the pack are a further 10  completely different 89' Autoraks both Bi-level and Tri-level,
Part 4  Comprises 1 x CP, 2 x CR, 1 x CSX, 3 x NS, 1 x TTX, and 2 x UP

There is a copletely new shape file in this add-on pack for the taller tri-level TTQX/ 20-2 series cars and
6 of the 10 cars are on this new shape.

to use and place the resulting folder from unzipping "Autoracks_Jeff_A" into the Trains/Trainset folder
within MSTS, create a consist using the MSTS editor, Conbuilder or your favourite utility.

If you have downloaded any of the other parts of this set (currently 4 parts including this one) they will
all share the same folder and therefore the truck ace files will want to overwrite any previous ones, that 
is ok. in some instances,( depends on unzipping program and various PC configurations), you may have to 
manually copy the contents of each part into the one main one, as in some cases in beta testing 3 seperate 
folders were created.
