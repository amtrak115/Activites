MSTS 89' Autorack Pack Part 2

Contained within the pack are Twenty completely different 89' Autoraks both Bi-level and Tri-level,
Part 2  Comprises 3 x ATSF, 3 x BN, 5 x BNSF, 1 x C&O, 3 x CR, 1 x FEC, 1 x KCS, 2 x NS and 1 x TFM

to use and place the resulting folder from unzipping "Autoracks_Jeff_A" into the Trains/Trainset folder
within MSTS, create a consist using the MSTS editor, Conbuilder or your favourite utility.

If you have downloaded any of the other parts of this set (currently 3 parts) they will all share the
same folder and therefore the two truck ace files will want to overwrite any previous ones, that is ok.
in some instances,( depends on unzipping program and various PC configurations), you may have to manually
copy the contents of each part into the one main one, as in some cases in beta testing 3 seperate folders
were created.
