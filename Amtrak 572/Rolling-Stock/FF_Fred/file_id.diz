MSTS Funnelfan's FRED
A new highly detailed FRED based on a Southern Pacific Prototype still used by UP (and very similar to the UP ones). This FRED is designed to work with the new trucks and couplers on my latest Centerbeams and Railbox sets, but can be used on any car as it works like any other freightcar in MSTS. This is a great item to place on the end of your train. Also included are the TSM (Train Sim Modeler) files for my new trucks and couplers, that can be used by other modelers to update thier own rolling stock. Shapes and Textures by Ted Curphey.
