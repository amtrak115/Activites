BACKGROUND:

This is my meager attempt to provide a stand-in for the San Diego Trolley.  If you are not familiar with the territory, the San Diego Trolley runs parallel to the former ATSF line from south of downtown San Diego to just north of Old Town.  As such it is a prominent part of both the Surfliner and Surliner2 routes in the File Library as TrainSim.com.  I would guess that it is almost impossible to run a train on that stretch of railroad without seeing at least one of the highly visible red cars along the way.  

The Siemens Duewag U2 light rail vehicles are probably the best-known of the San Diego Trolley cars.  Unfortunately there are no readily available models in the MS Train Sim universe.  Likewise, I could not locate any correct models of either of the other two classes of cars (Siemens SD100, S70) used on the system.

Having been frustrated by the lack of activity on what should be a faily busy right of way, I decided to use the models included in this archive.  While not a perfect solution, I believe that they capture the flavor of San Diego Trolley operations and are a decent stand-in until more accurate models become available.


CONTENTS:

This package consists of the necessary shape, texture, and engine files for the front, middle, and rear units that make up each three-unit light rail vehicle.  This package also includes the original cabview and sound folders created by Alexander Pohlemann.  I have included a copy of the original readme file that for more information and detailed operation of the light rail vehicles if so desired.

For those folks who may be so inclined, I have included a pair of short activities to run the MSTS version of the San Diego Trolley.  Otherwise, I plan to use these model in some upcoming activity packages.
