Taken collectively, these represent my third group of models created for MSTS using TSM.  However, they are the first to reach completion for upload to the File Library.


BACKGROUND:

The source of this idea came to me as a result of repeatedly seeing the static cars in Allentown Yard on Werner Mueller's Lehigh Valley route.  I eventually opened the route in the editor and took a good look at how the cars were made.  They were a basic structure skinned to look like a number of cars coupled together.  As such, they were very friendly to the frame rates in MSTS.  A search of the credits revealed that they were created by P.C. Wise (Hobart).

The only problem was the fact that the cars were *always* present whenever you ran the route.  That, and the fact that they had to be placed in the Route Editor, a task that was certainly not for everyone.  

Eventually it dawned on me that I could make something similar that could be used by activity makers.  By creating a "car" of varying lengths and adding a set of textures to it, I could populate yard tracks in the sim while keeping frame rates reasonable.  In addition to the low-poly nature of the "cars" themselves, the sim will have to calculate the physics for fewer "cars" when the longer strings are used.  (A reduction of up to fifteen to one.)  As an added bonus, the "cars" would show up in the Activity Editor, thus avoiding the problem of inadvertently running a train service through them.

CONTENTS:

This package consists of strings of various lengths of 40 foot boxcars, 50 foot boxcars, 40 foot cement hoppers, 34 foot coal hoppers (loaded and empty), and 54 foot covered hoppers.  These low-poly cars strings contain a fraction of the polys in a comparable string of more detailed cars.  I made a few departures from the original idea, namely adding axles to the low-poly trucks and adding crude couplers to the end of each string of cars.  These departures added polys but I believe that the overall appearance of the cars are improved.  This enables the strings to be used fairly close to the player in the sim.  If desired, you can add a "real" car to the end of the consist closest to the player to further disquise the "incomplete" nature of the string cars.

These car strings are very simplified and designed to be setup on straight tracks only.  Using these strings of cars on curved tracks may yield unpredictable (read ugly) results.  Sometimes this will only become apparent when passing the car strings in the sim.  Be careful with your placement!  In addition, the trucks (bogies) and wheels on these car strings are not animated, so I don't recommend using them in a player or AI train under most conditions.

After further consideration, I have included one car "strings" of the various cars in this selections.  These cars are animated at a basic level.  They can be used in the same manner as the longer strings with the benefit of being able to place them on curved yard tracks and sidings.  (The bogies will pivot.)  The tradeoff of using these cars in place of the longer strings is in the fact that the sim would have to calculate the additional physics, thus impacting overall performance.  Also, these cars can be used in player or AI trains.  I would recommend using them only where they would not be subjected to close scrutiny.


INSTALLATION:

1. To install, unzip, copy or move the CarStrings folder to your \Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset folder.
