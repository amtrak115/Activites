MSTS San Diego Coaster F59PHI Pack

The San Diego Coaster commuter service proved to be far more successful than anticipated at start up.  As a result, two F59PHI locomotives were ordered to supplement the five F40PH-2C locomotives that inaugurated the service.  This package contains both F59PH locomotives ordered by the Coaster (3001 & 3002) as well as three fictional repaints (3003, 3004 & 3005) for variety in setting up activities for San Diego Coaster service.

The original shape file and engine file for this locomotive was produced by Paul Burton.  The textures were done by Henry Triplett.

REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION INORMATION

To use these locomotives you should simply unzip the archive and more the "F59PHI_Coaster" folder to the TRAINSET folder of your MSTS installation.  

The engine file is set up to use Charlie Sibaja's EMD_F59PHI cab (emdf59cb.zip) and Midwest Locomotive Works EMD 710G version 2 sounds (mlw710g2.zip) from the Train-Sim.com File Library.  

Additional engine files aliased to the default DASH-9 cab and sound are also included for those who do not have access to the cab and sound files listed above.  Of course, you can always use your favorite cab and sounds files as well.
