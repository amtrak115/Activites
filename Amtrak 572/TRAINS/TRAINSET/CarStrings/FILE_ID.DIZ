MSTS Freight Car Strings - 2017 Revision.  

This revised package contains updates to the files released in 2005. This package consists of strings of one to fifteen low-poly freight cars that can be used in MSTS activities.  Designed for filling railyards and sidings in the background, they can be used closer to the player as well.  Adapted from an idea by P.C. Wise with textures from a number of contributors.  By Henry Triplett.
