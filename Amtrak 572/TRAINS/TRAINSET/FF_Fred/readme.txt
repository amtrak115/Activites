MSTS Funnelfan's FRED
A new highly detailed FRED based on a Southern Pacific Prototype still used by UP (and very similar to the UP ones). This FRED is designed to work with the new trucks and couplers on my latest Centerbeams and Railbox sets, but can be used on any car as it works like any other freightcar in MSTS. This is a great item to place on the end of your train. Also included are the TSM (Train Sim Modeler) files for my new trucks and couplers, that can be used by other modelers to update thier own rolling stock. Shapes and Textures by Ted Curphey.

Installation:

Run the included .EXE file to install car following the instructions.


Use of TSM Files.

If you use the new trucks and couplers on your models, please mention that you used funnelfan's trucks and couplers on documentation for public releases. Both payware and freeware odelers are welcomed to use the new hardware in hopes of standardization. The FF_Hardware50 files has standard airhose connections while FF_Hardware60 file has a coiled airhose connection used with cars that have end of car cushioning devices (to provide slack). You will need to adjust the location of the trucks, and couplers for each model for best results. The final size of each model should be minus .3 meters less that the actual length of a model as determind by the bounding box feature in Shape Viewer. So if the model has a bounding box of 25.836 meters, the .wag file size should be 25.536 meters. This will line up the couplers and airhose connections perfectly.
