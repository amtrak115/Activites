MSTS MOW train set.  This is a repaint of the CSX MOW train set and  the SP bay window caboose done with the permission of the authors.  This new set has cars with MOW markings but no roadnames so it can be used on a variety of routes.  Credits to the original authors are found in the Readme file. It is important to read all the notes in the Readme file before attempting to use the cars.  Updated physics by Bob "Plainsman" Boudoin.  Repainted by Mark Giltz
