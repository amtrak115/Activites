MSTS Northwest Reefer Pack #1

  This is a set of 8 new and reworked older reefers. All the reefers feature my newest hardware in two versions. Included are two brand new BNFE "Western Fruit Express" 57' mechanical reefers, and brand new 80' CRYX "Cryo-Trans" Hi-cube reefer with an external refridgeration unit. Also included are reworked versions of my BNSF and UP 80' Hi-Cube reefers, as well as the three Cryo Reefers (one Cryo-Trans/McCain, and two Lamb Weston cars). These cars are most often found on the high priority manifest freights hauling perishables. Models and Textures by Ted Curphey.


Installation:

Extract the .exe file and run it. It will guide you through the installation process.

Note: This file will not overwrite my older reefers if you have those installed. You will need to manaually edit consists to point to the new cars which are in a new generic folder titled "reefers" and may have different file names than the original


REPAINTERS!!!
All repaints or other modifications need to be approved by me before they are uploaded to any MSTS library. I will seek the removal of any files not approved by myslef. Also, I WILL NOT approve any repaints that fail to have each side of the car properly skinned. All but the Cryo Reefers in this set need a photo of each side of the car to correctly show the details on each side of the car. Also, all repaints should follow the same naming convention that I've setup using the "name" tag in the .wag file. Examples include:

Name ( "Ref57 BN-2" ) = Reefer 57' BN second version
Name ( "Ref80 CRYX-1" ) = Reefer 80' CRYX first version
Name ( "RefCryo FURX-2" ) = Reefer Cryo FURX second version
